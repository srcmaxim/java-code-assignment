# Questions

1. In this code base, we have some different implementation strategies when it comes to database access layer and manipulation. If you would maintain this code base, would you refactor any of those? Why?

2. When it comes to API spec and endpoints handlers, we have an Open API yaml file for the `Warehouse` API from which we generate code, but for the other endpoints - `Product` and `Store` - we just coded directly everything. What would be your thoughts about what are the pros and cons of each approach and what would be your choice?
